# ğŸ§  MNIST Digit Generator using GAN

This project uses a **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** to generate realistic-looking handwritten digits based on the **MNIST dataset**. The model consists of a **generator** that creates fake images and a **discriminator** that tries to distinguish real images from fake ones. Over time, the generator improves and produces increasingly realistic digits.

## ğŸ”§ Built With
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## ğŸš€ Features
- Trains GAN on MNIST data
- Saves generated images during training
- Visualizes progress with image grid output

## ğŸ“‚ Output
Generated digit images are saved as PNG files (e.g., `gan_images_1000.png`).
